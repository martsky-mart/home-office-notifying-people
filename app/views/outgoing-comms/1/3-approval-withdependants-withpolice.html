            <p>Your Tier 4 (General) student visa application with dependants has been approved.</p>
            <p> You have been given permission to study:</p>

            <p>Course: Electronic engineering
                <br/> Sponsor: Manchester University
                <br/> Address: Faculty of Engineering, Electronic House, M2 4TG</p>

            <p><strong>Dependants approved to remain in the UK</strong></p>

            <p>Dependant 1
                <br/> Dependant 2</p>

            <p>We will send your biometric residence permit (BRP) within 7 working days. The courier will need proof of identity and a signature. See <a href="http://gov.uk/brp">gov.uk/brp</a> for more information about the BRP. </p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Travelling out of the UK?</h3>
            <p>You should not make any travel arrangements until you receive your BRP. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">What you need to do now </h2>
            <p>You must register with the police within 7 days of receiving your BRP. Police registration information is no longer displayed on BRPs. You must still register. Dependants under the age of 16 do not need to register. </p>

            <p>See <a href="gov.uk/register-with-the-police">gov.uk/register-with-the-police</a> for information about where to go and what documents to take. </p>

            <p>Go to <a href="http://gov.uk/leaflet.to.come">gov.uk/leaflet.to.come</a> for the conditions of your stay in the UK.</p>

            <p>If you have been granted less time than applied for, you may get a partial refund of your Immigration Health Surcharge payment.</p>

            <p>If you’re unhappy with the amount or conditions of your leave you can ask for your application to be reviewed. See <a href="http://gov.uk/ask-for-a-visa-administrative-review/if-youre-in-the-uk">gov.uk/ask-for-a-visa-administrative-review/if-youre-in-the-uk</a>.</p>
